                        Mexico is one of the countries in the world with the best
                        food culture. In fact, Mexico is considered to have the second
                        best food in the whole world. Mexicans are famous for
                        using a lot of seasoning in their food such as chili
                        powder, turmeric powder, garlic, paprika, cardamom and
                        more. They also use a lot of corn and avocado in their
                        cooking. Some of the world's most famous dishes are
                        Mexican. For example tacos, churros, and burritos.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The staple food of Mexico is of course corn. If there’s
                        something mexicans can’t live without, then it is
                        definitely corn. For many thousands of years people
                        in Mexico have eaten corn in many different ways. Two
                        of the most significant mexican way to eat corn are Hominy
                        and Masa. Hominy is corn that’s been treated with alkali
                        that removes germs and hulls. Masa is a bread made of
                        Hominy and other ingredients. Hominy can be used in soups,
                        and Masa as a side dish.

                        The normal time for eating lunch in Mexico is usually between 2 and 3pm and they eat very
                        slowly. They call it “La hora de la comida”. It is later than most countries in the world. It’s
                        the same with dinner, which Mexicans usually eat around 9pm. Often family and friends eat
                        together and the guests are expected to arrive at least 30 minutes later than the planned time.

                        </br>
                        Mexican people of all ages love to play and watch football,
                        or fútbol as it's called in spanish. Football has been the
                        biggest sport in the country for many generations, and is
                        nos more popular than it has ever been in Mexico. Many
                        people even see their favorite football team as their
                        religion. Even though football is the most popular sport,
                        their national sport involves horses and is called Charríera.

                        Football culture in Mexico is known for being very hectic,
                        aggressive, and controversial. But this is because all the Mexican
                        fans are ready to do anything for their teams. They
                        are always engaged with their favorite team. As a result
                        of the football's popularity, Mexico owns one of the top
                        ten best football leagues in the whole world, Liga MX.

                        </br>

                        More than 41% of Mexicans watch sports every day. Not only
                        because it’s entertaining, but also because watching sports
                        is an excuse to be social and meet friends and family. Their
                        passion for sports is brought further to the new generation.
                        That’s why the kids in Mexico support the same team as
                        their older relatives.

                        An average mexican is a lot more talkative and social
                        than an average swede. It’s because Mexicans spend a lot of time
                        with family and friends in general. In Mexico, family is very
                        important. Most families even live in the same house with many
                        relatives. Mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa etc.

                        </br>

                        Mexikans are used to talk to each other in a friendly way.
                        For example, they say “we’ll see” or “maybe” instead of saying
                        “no” because it doesn’t sound rude. Another way to communicate
                        with each other is by using hand gestures and physical contact.
                        But not hugging, because it’s reserved for family.

                        In Mexico, religion is a big part of the everyday life.
                        Most people are Catholics with some features from old
                        indigenous religions. Over 80% of the population consider
                        themselves as Catholics. The high percentage of religious
                        people has affected the language they use in Mexico.
                        Several everyday phrases are related to god. For example,
                        "Si Dios quiere” (God willing), “Dios te bendiga”
                        (God bless you) and “Gracias a Dios” (Thank God).
