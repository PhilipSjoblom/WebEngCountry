    <h3>Food in Mexico</h3>
    </br>
        Mexico is one of the countries in the world with the best
        food culture. In fact, Mexico is considered to have the second
        best food in the whole world. Mexicans are famous for
        using a lot of seasoning in their food such as chili 
        powder, turmeric powder, garlic, paprika, cardamom and
        more. They also use a lot of corn and avocado in their
        cooking. Some of the world's most famous dishes are
        Mexican. For example tacos, churros, and burritos.
    </br>
    </br>
        
        The staple food of Mexico is of course corn. If there’s 
        something mexicans can’t live without, then it is
        definitely corn. For many thousands of years people
        in Mexico have eaten corn in many different ways. Two 
        of the most significant mexican way to eat corn are Hominy 
        and Masa. Hominy is corn that’s been treated with alkali 
        that removes germs and hulls. Masa is a bread made of 
        Hominy and other ingredients. Hominy can be used in soups,
        and Masa as a side dish.

        The normal time for eating lunch in Mexico is usually between 2 and 3pm and they eat very slowly. They call it “La hora de la comida”. It is later than most countries in the world. It’s the same with dinner, which Mexicans usually eat around 9pm. Often family and friends eat together and the guests are expected to arrive at least 30 minutes later than the planned time.

    <div id="sports"><h3>Sports</h3>
    </br>
        Mexican people of all ages love to play and watch football,
        or fútbol as it's called in spanish. Football has been the
        biggest sport in the country for many generations, and is
        nos more popular than it has ever been in Mexico. Many
        people even see their favorite football team as their 
        religion. Even though football is the most popular sport, 
        their national sport involves horses and is called Charríera.
    </br>
    </br>
        
        Football culture in Mexico is known for being very hectic, 
        aggressive, and controversial. But this is because all the Mexican 
        fans are ready to do anything for their teams. They 
        are always engaged with their favorite team. As a result
        of the football's popularity, Mexico owns one of the top
        ten best football leagues in the whole world, Liga MX.
    </br>
    </br>
        
        More than 41% of Mexicans watch sports every day. Not only
        because it’s entertaining, but also because watching sports 
        is an excuse to be social and meet friends and family. Their
        passion for sports is brought further to the new generation.
        That’s why the kids in Mexico support the same team as 
        their older relatives.

<div id="social"><h3>Social</h3>
</br>
        An average mexican is a lot more talkative and social 
        than an average swede. It’s because Mexicans spend a lot of time
        with family and friends in general. In Mexico, family is very
        important. Most families even live in the same house with many
        relatives. Mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa etc. 
        
    </br>
    </br>

        Mexikans are used to talk to each other in a friendly way.
        For example, they say “we’ll see” or “maybe” instead of saying
        “no” because it doesn’t sound rude. Another way to communicate
        with each other is by using hand gestures and physical contact.
        But not hugging, because it’s reserved for family.

        In Mexico, religion is a big part of the everyday life.
        Most people are Catholics with some features from old 
        indigenous religions. Over 80% of the population consider
        themselves as Catholics. The high percentage of religious
        people has affected the language they use in Mexico. 
        Several everyday phrases are related to god. For example,
        "Si Dios quiere” (God willing), “Dios te bendiga” 
        (God bless you) and “Gracias a Dios” (Thank God).
