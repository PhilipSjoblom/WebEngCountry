                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    The history of Mexico spans thousands of years, back to when the Mayans, Azteks and several other
                    civilisations inhabited the land.
                    <br>
                    This rich history has left a lasting impact on the country, with the culture of Mexico being a
                    vibrant mix of indigenous and Spanish influences.
                    <br><br>
                    The culture of Mexico is characterised by a strong sense of family, religion, and tradition, with
                    festivals, music, and dance playing a significant role in the lives of the Mexican people.

                <h2>Traditions</h2>
                <p>
                    The people of Mexico showcase the effects of generations of mixing between the indigenous people and
                    the Spanish colonists, together forming a cohesive collective characterised by a distinct blend of
                    traditions, rituals and customs.
                    <br><br>
                    This vibrant culture manifests itself perfectly in, for instance,
                    the Day of the Dead tradition, where the deceased are remembered and celebrated with spectacular
                    displays of colour through clothing, decoration and food, such as the characteristic sugar skulls
                    indicative of the holiday.
